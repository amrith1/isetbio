function thisR = setNavarroAccommodation(thisR, accommodation, workingFolder)
% Change renderRecipe to match the accommodation
%
% Syntax:
%   thisR = setNavarroAccommodation(thisR, accommodation, workingFolder)
%
% Description:
%    We change the fields of the thisR to match accommodation. As
%    accommodation changes, the lens file will change, as will the index of
%    refraction for the lens media. We write these new files out and
%    reference them in the structure.
%
% Inputs:
%    thisR         - Object (Render recipe)
%    accommodation - Numeric. The accommodation to shape the modified
%                    thisR by.
%    workingFolder - String. The file location to write the new
%                    renderRecipe to.
%
% Outputs:
%    thisR          - Object. The modified render recipe.
%
% Optional key/value pairs:
%    None.

%% Write out ocular media spectra files
% We calculate the dispersion curves of each ocular media. In the lens
% file, each surface material is linked to an "ior slot" (ior1, 
% ior2, etc.) When the ray is traveling through that material, it will
% follow the curve defined by the spectrum in the corresponding slot.

% Our convention (hard coded in writeNavarroLensFile) is always:
% ior1 --> cornea
% ior2 --> aqueuous
% ior3 --> lens
% ior4 --> vitreous
