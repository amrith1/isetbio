% Numbers to rremember
%
% When fixated, Beau claims FOV is -65 deg (in) to 105 deg (out)
%                                  -74 deg (down) to 62 deg (up)
%
% Definitions: The highest spatial freq that can be detected with a
% contrast = 1 was used to define the 'Window' of visibility.  This extends
% to analysis say if the contrast is lower than one what range of spatial
% and temporal frequencies can be detected.  Adding these lower contrasts
% is how the pyramid (3D) is built on the window (2D).

%% The Kelly spatial-temporal frequency contrast sensitivity function

% In 1979 Don Kelly published a formula defining the space-time contrast
% sensitivity function.  Suppose we define spatial frequency (cycles per
% degree) and temporal frequency (hz).  ISETBio has an interface to return
% the Kelly estimate


% Watson says use linear spacing for his pyramid.  So we create a set of
% linear sample values
fs = linspace(1, 30, 80);
ft = linspace(1, 60, 100);

% Row is space, col is time
contrastSensitivity = humanSpaceTime('kelly79', fs, ft);

%  Visualize the Kelly data using a log(contrastSensitivity).  As Beau
%  points out, the 
surf(ft, fs, contrastSensitivity);
set(gca, 'xscale', 'linear', 'yscale', 'linear','zscale','log');
set(gca, 'xlim', [0 35], 'ylim', [0 20]);
xlabel('Temporal freq (Hz)');
ylabel('Spatial freq (cpd)')
zlabel('Log CS');

% I suggest rotating the surface in the window. 

% From this point of view, the planar shape, and the low frequency drop, is
% pretty clear.
az = 45; el = 0;
view([az,el]);

%%  Viewed from the top down, you see the Window of visibility

% Spatial and temporal frequencies inside the colored region are visible.
% The white points would require a stimulus you can't really make, with a
% contrast greater than 1.
az = 0; el = 90;
view([az el]);

%%  How the Pyramid is built

% For reasons I don't fully understand, Beau wants us to use negative
% spatial and temporal frequencies.  What does a F and -F sin(2*piF*x) look
% like? 
F = 2;
x = (0:0.01:1);
vP = sin(2*pi*F*x);
vN = sin(2*pi*(-1*F)*x);

% These stimuli are basically the same, but with opposite contrast - black
% is white and white is black. 
ieNewGraphWin;
p = plot(x,vP,'k-',x,vN,'k:');
for ii=1:2, p(ii).LineWidth = 2; end
legend({'Positive F','NegativeF '})

%% So, let's make the pyramid by following Beau's recipe.

Time = [fliplr(-ft),ft];   % The extended temporal frequencies
Space = [fliplr(-fs),fs];  % The extended spatial frequencies

% Nothing changes when you measure with positive or negative frequencies,
% so we can just rotate then paste the same contrast sensitivity function
% measured with all positive F and W into the other three quadrants, if F
% and W are allowed to become negative.
CS = [rot90(contrastSensitivity,2), flipud(contrastSensitivity);
    flipud(rot90(contrastSensitivity,-2)), contrastSensitivity];

%% Here is the Pyramid of Visibility.  

% I think we will be calling it the Volcano of Visibility (VoV), though.
[X,Y] = meshgrid(Time,Space);
surf(X,Y,CS)
ylabel('Space (cpd)');
xlabel('Time (Hz)');
zlabel('log CS')
set(gca, 'xscale', 'linear', 'yscale', 'linear','zscale','log');

%% Here is the 'Window of Visibility'

% In this case, we are 
ieNewGraphWin;
imagesc(Time,Space,CS)
ylabel('Space (cpd)');
xlabel('Time (Hz)');
colorbar;

%% Eccentricity

% Suppose we are at an eccentricity that scales the effective spatial
% frequency by a factor of 2.  Then

ieNewGraphWin;
eccFactor = 2;
surf(X,Y/eccFactor,CS)
ylabel('Space (cpd)'); xlabel('Time (Hz)'); zlabel('log CS')
set(gca, 'xscale', 'linear', 'yscale', 'linear','zscale','log');
set(gca, 'xlim', [-40 40], 'ylim', [-40 40]);
title(sprintf('Eccentricity factor %.1f',eccFactor));

%% END

%{
For applications, we would like to know how the original shape measured by
Kelly (and others varies with (a) eccentricity, (b) luminance level, and
(c) color.  We would also like an image computable calculation that shows
how to use this information.

Beau describes his approach to including eccentricity in Equations (4) and
(5). Scale the spatial frequency as if it is a higher spatial frequency
than its true physical size, and the scaling factor is given by a linear
dependence on eccentricity.

Want to build a Matlab function that takes an image in and produces a
sensitivity curve like the Volcano of Visibility for the fovea?  And then
for different eccentricities.

%% Paper notes 
%
% The first linear equation
%
%    (Equation 1)
%    S = C0 + CW W + CF F + CL L
%
%  S = Log contrast sensitivity
%  W - Temporal Freq  (Hz)
%  F - Spatial Freq   (cpd)
%  L - Luminance (cd/m2)
%
% He will give us the constants at some point
%
% What is the pyramid?  Suppose you fix L at 100.  Then you have
%
%    S = C0' + CW W + CF F
% 
% This is probably OK for the positive quadrant.  If he had put an absolute
% value around W and F then values in the other three quadrants would
% always be the same as the value in the all positive quadrant.
%
% Which is Figure 2.  To be a pyramid, notice, we need both positive and
% negative frequency values.  Hmmm.  What does that mean exactly?  It
% imposes symmetry in some sense.  But the formula for the pyramid doesn't
% really work with that.  If we have +F  and -F the S valuke would be quite
% different in the linear equation.  So, what's up?
%
%   Figure 2 plots the points that satsify this linear equation.  These
%   points form a surface.  For example, take the points where S = 0.  For
%   those points, when L is a fixed luminance level, we have
%   
%        0 = (K) + CW W + CF F, where K = C0 + CL L
%
%        -K   = CW W + CF F
%       -(CW W + K)  = CF F
%
%  If the weights are both 1 you can see that this is just
%
%        F =  -W + K
%        W =  F - K

%% Questions and Notes
%
% (We should conditionalize on size and duration of the grating, also mean
% luminance/color) 
%
% What is the formula for the CSF in Figure 1?  Maybe the formula is in
% Refs 5-9?  Not obvious, though.
